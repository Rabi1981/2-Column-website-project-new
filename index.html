     <p>Domestic cats are often called 'house cats' when kept as indoor pets.[5] Cats have been domesticated (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years.[6]
They are one of the most popular pets in the world. They are kept by humans for hunting rodents and as friends.
There are also farm cats, which are kept on farms to keep rodents away; and feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away from humans.[7]
A cat is sometimes called a kitty. A young cat is called a kitten.[8] A female cat that has not had its sex organs removed is called a queen. A male cat that has not had its sex organs removed is called a tom.
There are about 92 breeds of cat.[9] Domestic cats are found in shorthair, longhair, and hairless breeds. Cats which are not specific breeds can be referred to as 'domestic shorthair' (DSH) or 'domestic longhair' (DLH).
The word 'cat' is also used for other felines. Felines are usually called either big cats or small cats. The big, wild cats are well known: lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, pumas, and cheetahs. There are small wild cats in most parts of the world, such as the lynx in northern Europe. The big cats and wild cats are not tame, and can be very dangerous.

<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>In the past, mostly in Egypt, people kept domestic cats because they hunted and ate mice and rats. Today, people often keep cats as pets. There are also domestic cats which live without being cared for by people. These kinds of cats are called "feral cats" or "stray cats".
The oldest evidence of cats kept as pets is from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, around 7500 BC. Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as gods, and often mummified them so they could be with their owners "for all of eternity".
